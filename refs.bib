abstract = "Rapid compression machines (RCMs) are used to simulate a single compression stroke of an internal combustion engine without some of the complicated swirl bowl geometry, cycle-to-cycle variation, residual gas, and other complications associated with engine operating conditions. RCMs are primarily used to measure ignition delay times as a function of temperature, pressure, and fuel/oxygen/diluent ratio; further they can be equipped with diagnostics to determine the temperature and flow fields inside the reaction chamber and to measure the concentrations of reactant, intermediate, and product species produced during combustion. This paper first discusses the operational principles and design features of RCMs, including the use of creviced pistons, which is an important feature in order to suppress the boundary layer, preventing it from becoming entrained into the reaction chamber via a roll-up vortex. The paper then discusses methods by which experiments performed in RCMs are interpreted and simulated. Furthermore, differences in measured ignition delays from RCMs and shock tube facilities are discussed, with the apparent initial gross disagreement being explained by facility effects in both types of experiments. Finally, future directions for using RCMs in chemical kinetics studies are also discussed."

Recent shock tube developments include the use of driver inserts to counteract the small pressure gradient seen in conventional reflected shock wave experiments and the use of a constrained-reaction-volume strategy to enable the implementation of near-constant-pressure gasdynamic test conditions during energetic processes. Recent laser absorption developments include the use of a CO2 laser absorption sensor to accurately monitor temperature during shock wave experiments, the use of multi-wavelength laser absorption strategies to simultaneously monitor multiple species time-histories, and the used of isotopic labeling strategies to identify individual reaction sites during the measurement of elementary reaction rate constants. The improved ability to accurately constrain the test conditions in shock tube experiments, combined with non-intrusive, species-sensitive and quantitative laser absorption diagnostics, is enabling experimenters to provide a new generation of high-quality experimental kinetics targets for combustion chemistry model validation and refinement. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of newly emerging laser-diagnostic techniques and a summary of future research directions."

In this paper, A/GRACE (part A of GRACE) is explained, which prepares elementary reaction networks for radical reactions. The reactant and the product are represented by square symmetric matrices. The off-diagonal elements represent bond multiplicity, or the number of localized electrons, between corresponding atoms, whereas the diagonal elements imply the number of unshared electrons on radical atoms. A reacting system, an ensemble of the participating molecules, is composed of atom groups, each of which consists of a center atom (usually non-hydrogen) and attached hydrogen atom(s), if any. Firstly, all the possible changes in the atom groups are selected, and the permitted combinations are preapred bearing in mind the equivalent groups in the system and the restrictions optioned. The major restriction is the complexity, i.e., the number of ruptured or formed bonds. A direct sum of matrices are prepared from one of the combinations, and the elementary reaction is completed by setting the appropriate numerals, 1 or −1, to the outside elements. Secondly, the procedures are repeated until all the feasible networks are prepared. As an illustration the hydrogenation of ethylene over a heterogeneous catalyst has been cited. }

Species thermochemistry is estimated through Benson group additivity and reaction rate coefficients are estimated using a database of known rate rules and reaction templates. At its core, RMG relies on two fundamental data structures: graphs and trees. Graphs are used to represent chemical structures, and trees are used to represent thermodynamic and kinetic data. Models are generated using a rate-based algorithm which excludes species from the model based on reaction fluxes. RMG can generate reaction mechanisms for species involving carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, sulfur, and nitrogen. It also has capabilities for estimating transport and solvation properties, and it automatically computes pressure-dependent rate coefficients and identifies chemically-activated reaction paths. RMG is an object-oriented program written in Python, which provides a stable, robust programming architecture for developing an extensible and modular code base with a large suite of unit tests. Computationally intensive functions are cythonized for speed improvements.

The recent developments in this field of chemical reaction engineering are anticipated to lead to some groundbreaking discoveries in the future, extending our fundamental understanding and resolving many of today's society problems such as energy production and conversion, emission reduction, greener chemical production processes, etc. In the present review, the focus is on the core of these automated mechanism generation for gas-phase and solution-phase processes that is on how the reaction kinetics and thermodynamic and transport properties of species are estimated and calculated starting from the fundamental elements of the software. With tasks such as the definition of reaction rules and reaction families, the unambiguous representation of species, and the choice of different termination criteria, generating a good reaction mechanism is still not as simple as pressing a “run” button. One of the main challenges that still needs to be overcome is how to deal with data scarcity and the combination with affordable computational chemistry calculations seems the logical step forward. The best practices are illustrated in a butane pyrolysis case study, which also exposes the challenges in the field of automatic kinetic model generation.}

abstract = {The symmetry of molecules and transition states of elementary reactions is an essential property with important implications for computational chemistry. The automated identification of symmetry by computers is a very useful tool for many applications, but often relies on the availability of three-dimensional coordinates of the atoms in the molecule and hence becomes less useful when these coordinates are a priori unavailable. This article presents a new algorithm that identifies symmetry of molecules and transition states based on an augmented graph representation of the corresponding structures, in which both topology and the presence of stereocenters are accounted for. The automorphism group order of the graph associated with the molecule or transition state is used as a starting point. A novel concept of label-stereoisomers, that is, stereoisomers that arise after labeling homomorph substituents in the original molecule so that they become distinguishable, is introduced and used to obtain the symmetry number. The algorithm is characterized by its generic nature and avoids the use of heuristic rules that would limit the applicability. The calculated symmetry numbers are in agreement with expected values for a large and diverse set of structures, ranging from asymmetric, small molecules such as fluorochlorobromomethane to highly symmetric structures found in drug discovery assays. The new algorithm opens up new possibilities for the fast screening of the degree of symmetry of large sets of molecules. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}

abstract="We offer an overview of the popular one- dimensional (1-D) hindered rotor model that is often used for quantum mechanical treatment of internal rotation. This model is put in context with other methods used for treating anharmonic motions. The 1-D hindered rotor scheme is general for tops of any symmetry and has been used to provide accurate treatment of hindered rotors in a wide range of systems. One obstacle preventing wider use of the model is its lack of incorporation into common electronic structure codes. We have developed an algorithm for consistently treating all tops in a molecule, and we present simple codes which interface with electronic structure codes to provide thermochemical properties (S, Cp, H) of individual species and reactions that have been corrected for internal rotations. Finally, we use this approach to give sensible advice about how the model can be used best. We show that dramatic changes in the reduced moment of inertia do not necessarily cause comparable changes in the properties of individual hindered rotors. We demonstrate that the rotational hindrance potential can be accurately determined using relatively coarse step sizes. Finally, we show that internal rotation in transition states can be treated using a ``frozen transition state'' approximation at a significant computational savings. We also discuss the relationship between calculated properties of hindered rotors and the choice of method and basis set used.",

The ever-growing computational power and availability of high performance computing solutions allows to envisage implementing on-the-fly ab initio calculations for a large number of reaction rate coefficients. Today extensive user knowledge and involvement is required to develop fast and effective ab initio based kinetic models. The present work introduces a series of automation procedures to minimize user involvement. It allows automated quantum chemical calculations for a large number of reactions for gas-phase processes with a wide variety in chemical species. 3D coordinates are calculated for all the reactants, products and transition states and automatically submitted to quantum chemistry packages. The latter yield accurate high-pressure limit rate coefficients. All steps are automated without the need for manual interventions, even for recognizing rotational frequencies and for verifying whether the saddle point searches lead to the appropriate transition state. A good agreement to literature data is found, i.e., most of the rate coefficients are within a factor of 2 of literature data."

abstract = {Jaguar is an ab initio quantum chemical program that specializes in fast electronic structure predictions for molecular systems of medium and large size. Jaguar focuses on computational methods with reasonable computational scaling with the size of the system, such as density functional theory (DFT) and local second-order Møller–Plesset perturbation theory. The favorable scaling of the methods and the high efficiency of the program make it possible to conduct routine computations involving several thousand molecular orbitals. This performance is achieved through a utilization of the pseudospectral approximation and several levels of parallelization. The speed advantages are beneficial for applying Jaguar in biomolecular computational modeling. Additionally, owing to its superior wave function guess for transition-metal-containing systems, Jaguar finds applications in inorganic and bioinorganic chemistry. The emphasis on larger systems and transition metal elements paves the way toward developing Jaguar for its use in materials science modeling. The article describes the historical and new features of Jaguar, such as improved parallelization of many modules, innovations in ab initio pKa prediction, and new semiempirical corrections for nondynamic correlation errors in DFT. Jaguar applications in drug discovery, materials science, force field parameterization, and other areas of computational research are reviewed. Timing benchmarks and other results obtained from the most recent Jaguar code are provided. The article concludes with a discussion of challenges and directions for future development of the program. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}

abstract = {Abstract This article introduces MMFF94, the initial published version of the Merck molecular force field (MMFF). It describes the objectives set for MMFF, the form it takes, and the range of systems to which it applies. This study also outlines the methodology employed in parameterizing MMFF94 and summarizes its performance in reproducing computational and experimental data. Though similar to MM3 in some respects, MMFF94 differs in ways intended to facilitate application to condensed-phase processes in molecular-dynamics simulations. Indeed, MMFF94 seeks to achieve MM3-like accuracy for small molecules in a combined “organic/protein” force field that is equally applicable to proteins and other systems of biological significance. A second distinguishing feature is that the core portion of MMFF94 has primarily been derived from high-quality computational data—ca. 500 molecular structures optimized at the HF/6-31G* level, 475 structures optimized at the MP2/6-31G* level, 380 MP2/6-31G* structures evaluated at a defined approximation to the MP4SDQ/TZP level, and 1450 structures partly derived from MP2/6-31G* geometries and evaluated at the MP2/TZP level. A third distinguishing feature is that MMFF94 has been parameterized for a wide variety of chemical systems of interest to organic and medicial chemists, including many that feature frequently occurring combinations of functional groups for which little, if any, useful experimental data are available. The methodology used in parameterizing MMFF94 represents a fourth distinguishing feature. Rather than using the common “functional group” approach, nearly all MMFF parameters have been determined in a mutually consistent fashion from the full set of available computational data. MMFF94 reproduces the computational data used in its parameterization very well. In addition, MMFF94 reproduces experimental bond lengths (0.014 Å root mean square [rms]), bond angles (1.2° rms), vibrational frequencies (61 cm−1 rms), conformational energies (0.38 kcal/mol/rms), and rotational barriers (0.39 kcal/mol rms) very nearly as well as does MM3 for comparable systems. MMFF94 also describes intermolecular interactions in hydrogen-bonded systems in a way that closely parallels that given by the highly regarded OPLS force field. © 1996 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.}

The method uses derivatives of calculated values for properties with respect to adjustable parameters to obtain the optimized values of parameters. The large increase in speed is a result of using a simple series expression for calculated values of properties rather than employing full semiempirical calculations. With this optimization procedure, the rate-determining step for parameterizing elements changes from the mechanics of parameterization to the assembling of experimental reference data.}

In general, the symmetry number is given by the ratio of the reactant and transition state rotational symmetry numbers. However, special care is advised in the evaluation of symmetry numbers in the following situations: (i) if the reaction is symmetric, (ii) if reactants and/or transition states are chiral, (iii) if the reaction has multiple conformers for reactants and/or transition states and, (iv) if there is an internal rotation of part of the molecular system. All these four situations are treated systematically and analyzed in detail in the present article. We also include a large number of examples to clarify some complicated situations, and in the last section we discuss an example involving an achiral diasteroisomer.",

In ASE, tasks are fully scripted in Python. The powerful syntax of Python combined with the NumPy array library make it possible to perform very complex simulation tasks. For example, a sequence of calculations may be performed with the use of a simple ‘for-loop’ construction. Calculations of energy, forces, stresses and other quantities are performed through interfaces to many external electronic structure codes or force fields using a uniform interface. On top of this calculator interface, ASE provides modules for performing many standard simulation tasks such as structure optimization, molecular dynamics, handling of constraints and performing nudged elastic band calculations.}

Since the transportation cost plays an important role in VMI and because the demands are often fuzzy, this paper develops a VMI model in a multi-retailer single-vendor SCM under the consignment stock policy. The aim is to find optimal retailers’ order quantities so that the total inventory and transportation cost are minimized while several constraints are satisfied. Because of the NP-hardness of the problem, an algorithm based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) is proposed to find a near optimum solution, where the centroid defuzzification method is employed for defuzzification. Since there is no benchmark available in the literature, another meta-heuristic, namely genetic algorithm (GA), is presented in order to verify the solution obtained by PSO. Besides, to make PSO faster in finding a solution, it is improved by a local search. The parameters of both algorithms are calibrated using the Taguchi method to have better quality solutions. At the end, conclusions are made and future research is recommended."

abstractNote = {Toluene is often used as a fluorescent tracer for fuel concentration measurements, but without considering whether it affects the auto-ignition properties of the base fuel. We investigate the auto-ignition of pure toluene and its influence on the auto-ignition of n-heptane and iso-octane/air mixtures under engine-relevant conditions at typical tracer concentrations. Ignition delay times {tau}{sub ign} were measured behind reflected shock waves in mixtures with air at {phi}=1.0 and 0.5 at p=40 bar, over a temperature range of T=700-1200 K and compared to numerical results using two different mechanisms. Based on the models, information is derived about the relative influence of toluene on {tau}{sub ign} on the base fuels as function of temperature. For typical toluene tracer concentrations {<=}10%, the ignition delay time {tau}{sub ign} changes by less than 10% in the relevant pressure and temperature range. (author)},

abstract = {Abstract There is much interest in determining the influence of molecular structure on the rate of combustion of hydrocarbons; the C7H16 isomers of heptane have been selected here as they exemplify all the different structural elements present in aliphatic, noncyclic hydrocarbons. With the exception of n-heptane itself, no autoignition studies have been carried out to date on the other isomers of heptane at high temperatures. Therefore, ignition delay times were measured for the oxidation of four isomers—n-heptane, 2,2-dimethylpentane, 2,3-dimethylpentane, and 2,2,3-trimethylbutane—under stoichiometric conditions at a reflected shock pressure of 2 atm, within the temperature range of 1150–1650 K. Measurements under identical conditions reveal that they all have essentially the same ignition delay time; this confirms earlier theoretical predictions based purely on detailed chemical kinetic modeling. The variation of ignition delay times for n-heptane with changing oxygen concentrations and reflected shock pressure was determined and shown to follow expected trends. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

abstract = "Side-by-side comparison of detailed kinetic models using a new tool to aid recognition of species structures reveals significant discrepancies in the published rates of many reactions and thermochemistry of many species. We present a first automated assessment of the impact of these varying parameters on observable quantities of interest—in this case, autoignition delay—using literature experimental data. A recent kinetic model for the isomers of butanol was imported into a common database. Individual reaction rate and thermodynamic parameters of species were varied using values encountered in combustion models from recent literature. The effects of over 1600 alternative parameters were considered. Separately, experimental data were collected from recent publications and converted into the standard YAML-based ChemKED format. The Cantera-based model validation tool, PyTeCK, was used to automatically simulate autoignition using the generated models and experimental data, to judge the performance of the models. Taken individually, most of the parameter substitutions have little effect on the overall model performance, although a handful have quite large effects, and are investigated more thoroughly. Additionally, models varying multiple parameters simultaneously were evolved using a genetic algorithm to give fastest and slowest autoignition delay times, showing that changes exceeding a factor of 10 in ignition delay time are possible by cherry-picking from only accepted, published parameters. All data and software used in this study are available openly."
